# odin-recipes
A recipe website
## Description
This is my first coding project, created through The Odin Project HTML lesson. This is website that has links to 3 different recipes including a visual aid.
## What I Learned
Over the course of this project, I learned how the different parts of building a webpage work together. In the first few lessons of The Odin Project we went over things like git, index.html, making links, and many more individual concepts. Through putting together this website I have been able to combines everything I have learned and end up with a tangible result!
